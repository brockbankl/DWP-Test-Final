# DWP-Test-Final
DWP Digital Test 

Creating using Node.js / Express

Testing was done using jest and supertest to test against invalid coordinates, that all users were pulled from the base Swagger API given as part of the test and that the distance calculation worked as intended. 

To run the project, once downloaded, run an 'npm install' command to install the dependancies and start with either 'npm start' or 'nodemon app.js'. Thank you.
